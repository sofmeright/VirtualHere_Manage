# Virtual Here Manager
> A very simple script with the purpose of launching Virtual Here via CMD/CLI for use with Sunshine, Task Scheduler at boot, etc. When I tried to run Virtual Here directly from Sunshine commands in the Web UI, I was met with dissapointment that my Moonlight client would try to connect for a long time before failing. This could have easily been accomplished with a .bat file, yet I already had .ahk code written for another script.

### Features:
- Load Virtual Here at boot via Task Scheduler, on remote connection via Sunshine commands, or other methods; so you can bind usb devices directly to the client from the server. It's really simple!

### CMD/CLI Arguements:
Triggers Client_Start launched via script without arguments or executing directly.
> "C:\<pathto>\VH_Manage.ahk"[/.exe]

Exits the client.
> "C:\<pathto>\VH_Manage.ahk"[/.exe] Client_Exit

Starts the client. Filename is optional otherwise the client exe is expected to be in the same folder as the script.
> "C:\<pathto>\VH_Manage.ahk"[/.exe] Client_Start <filename>

Toggles the Server. Filename is optional otherwise the server exe is expected to be in the same folder as the script.
> "C:\<pathto>\VH_Manage.ahk"[/.exe] Server_Toggle <filename>

If the .ahk script is used first the Autohotkey executable must be passed through as the first arguement.

# Installation:
1. Unpack the .exe or the .ahk source file into the folder (optionally where you store the Virtual Here Client/Server executable ~ vhui64.exe). Note: If you wish to use the ".ahk" file (plain-text source code), you must install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com).
2. Set up a task in task scheduler or a command in the Sunshine WebUI to run the script.
> Extra Credit: To toggle install/uninstall of the VH Server as a service that runs at boot you can run "VH_Server-install_uninstall.exe" from the same folder that contains the server executable.

### Notes / Hints:
> This software is intended to make it a smoother experience while you are using Virtual Here as a solution for mounting USB devices on your machine to a different PC. When using the free version this will provide similar functionality to being able to install the client as a service if you add it to task scheduler to run at boot or launch via a sunshine command (This is listed as a paid feature however I have no way of detecting whether the server has a license or not). The developer of Virtual Here deserves to get paid for their work, buying a license also will enable you to use up to 63 devices. This script is not a substitute for a license by any means. I encourage you to purchase a license if you like the product.

### Integrating the tool with Sunshine:

<img src="https://github.com/sofmeright/IDDSampleDriver_Wizard/blob/main/PPIT-IddSample_Wiz-SS_Sunshine_Integration.png" width="300" />

> # Example:
> cmd /C "C:\_Staging\_Staging\VirtualHere\VH_Client-FreeInit.ahk"

Undo command:
> "C:\<pathto>\VH_Manage.ahk"[/.exe] Client_Exit

- For some strange reason its possible to execute the Virtual Here Client with a .bat but not directly from Sunshine and it is not a syntax issue as we are effectively doing the same thing with the script. I do not know the cause of this.
- Make sure to check the config.elevated option, admin is needed to launch Virtual Here, the tool will not run w/o elevation.
- Point the sunshine command to the "VH_Client-FreeInit.ahk", that's all.

### Current Issues / Workarounds:
- I don't think so.

### Planned Features:
> Nope. However feel free to raise issues if it does not work, but I find that highly unlikely as well.

### Dependencies / Requirements:
> This software seeks to launch Virtual Here as such you *obviously* would need Virtual Here. [Virtual Here Server](https://www.virtualhere.com/windows_server_software) & [Virtual Here Client](https://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software)

> This was written 100% with [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com), I first touched [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) in 2010 or so. Why AutoHotkey? [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) is super easy and efficient to carry out simple tasks programatically. I don't feel the need to pull out a more sophisticated language, honestly. In every release (I don't think there will ever be a new release of this ðŸ¤£) there is a ".ahk" plain-text source file, that you can inspect and even make changes. If you install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) you will be able to execute the source code directly.

 >If you do not like AutoHotkey... You are most entitled to that opinion, I encourage you to move right along and carry out this task however else you want. Otherwise as Deadpool said, MAXIMUM EFFORT!!! ðŸ¥´ AutoHotkey it is! ðŸ¤£
